# 📌 Featured Projects

### 🧠 Omni-Recall (AI Memory Assistant)
* Developing a cross-platform personal knowledge management system (Android & Web) designed to ingest and index user context in real-time.
* Implemented Android Accessibility Services and browser extensions to capture visual and textual data streams.
* Integrating multimodal LLMs (OpenAI/DeepSeek) to enable semantic search and "recall" of past digital interactions via natural language querying.

### 🔁 Crypto Trading System
* Developed a low-latency C++ trading system using WebSockets to interface with the Deribit exchange.
* Implemented core functionalities including order placement, cancellation, and real-time order book synchronization.

### ✍️ Probabilistic Misspelling Correction
* Built an NLP model for misspelling correction based on n-gram token prediction.
* Implemented advanced smoothing techniques (Good-Turing and Kneser-Ney) and used Damerau-Levenshtein distance for candidate generation.
* Achieved over 85% correction accuracy on test datasets.

### 🧮 Optimized PageRank Algorithm
* Implemented an optimized PageRank algorithm using sparse matrix representations and hashmaps for efficiency.
* Achieved O(n) time complexity per iteration, incorporating a damping factor and ensuring convergence guarantees.

### 🛠 Custom Compiler for Expression Language (E++)
* Designed and built a compiler for a custom statically typed language (E++).
* Translates E++ source code directly into machine code.
* Utilized AVL trees and min-heaps for highly memory-efficient variable allocation and management.

### 🎨 Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
* Implemented DDPMs in PyTorch for high-fidelity, realistic image generation, utilizing the `denoising-diffusion-pytorch` library.
* Constructed scalable U-Net-based diffusion pipelines to ensure efficient and high-quality generative modeling.

### 📜 Character-Level Text Generation (RNN)
* Built a multi-layer character-level RNN (using LSTM/GRU cells) in PyTorch for next-character prediction.
* Trained the model on a diverse corpus of Shakespearean and modern English texts.
* Integrated attention mechanisms, AdamW optimization, and dropout to improve model perplexity and capture long-term dependencies.

### 📈 Stock Price Prediction (HMM)
* Developed a stock price predictor using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).
* Model outperformed Support Vector Regression (SVR) on volatile stocks, evaluated using BIC and MAPE.
* Achieved approximately 1% prediction error on real-world data from Google, Apple, Qualcomm, and Comcast.

### 🤖 ML Classifiers from Scratch (SVM, Bagging, Boosting)
* Implemented hard and soft-margin Support Vector Machines (SVM) with linear and RBF kernels from scratch, using `cvxopt` for quadratic optimization.
* Built Adaboost and an error-weighted Random Forest from scratch, including bootstrapping and optimization logic.
* Achieved 94% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.
